# gpt2-poet

This project aims to finetune OpenAI's GPT-2 against a corpus of haikus using Pytorch, to attempt to generate coherent poetry.
Various decoders were implemented to learn about NLP models, and the output was analyzed.
<br/>
This project was started as part of a university project which required code to be demonstrated using a Python notebook.

## Future improvements
Future work was planned to attempt to implement a Generational Adversarial Network (GAN) to attempt to improve the outputs.
